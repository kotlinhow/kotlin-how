## Welcome to [**Kotlin.how**](https://kotlin.how).

**Kotlin.how** is a curated list of articles that offer approaches to different computational problems with [JetBrain](https://www.jetbrains.com/)'s [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language.

The first series of introductory articles will focus on algorithms to solve common computational problems in Kotlin.
